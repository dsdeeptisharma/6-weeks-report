The certificate generation system is flexible for generating progress reports of students. this application is mainly based on the database technology. the system is targeted to small enterprises, schools, colleges and universities. it can produce sophisticated ready-to-use Certificates, which could be created and will be ready to print.\\

Certificate Generation System is a portable application used to Generate Certificate for single candidate providing his/her details along with image.\\\\
As well as for Batch/Number of candidates by simply providing the CSV format file (containing details of every candidate) along with candidate images in a compressed (tar.gz or zip) folder.
\\\\
This project aims at developing a certificate generation system which can be used in universities to automate the distribution of digitally verifiable student result mark sheets\\\\
These methods have been developed in previous
work, but they were strongly dependent on particular programming and verification settings. This project
provides a more general development in the setting of abstract interpretation, showing the scalability of
certificate generation system.\\\\
Also,  this project is completely open source and the entire code is available to the user as and
when required.  There is Complete developer's Documentation as well as User manual alongwith
it that helps using it a lot easier.
