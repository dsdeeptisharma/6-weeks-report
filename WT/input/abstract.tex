This project discusses mainly about Weboctave. I devised this tool which basically is collection of direct and iterative methods to solve problems of various equations, matrices, graph plotting and ordinary linear equations.\\
The increasing importance of numerical methods in applied sciences have led to enhanced demand to deal with techniques of numerical analysis. The reason for this is that numerical methods can give the solution to applied problems when ordinary analytical methods fail.\\
Furthermore, coming back it deals with Weboctave which is web interface to use octave i.e. anyone can use this service and need not have octave installed on their systems and can use this service remotely.\\
Also, this project is completely open source and the entire code is available 
to the user as and when required. There is Complete developer's 
Documentation as well as User manual alongwith it that helps using it a lot easier.
