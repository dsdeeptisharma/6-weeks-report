\section{Problem Formulation}
 When analytical solution of the mathematically defined problem is possible but it is time-consuming and the error of approximation we can use Octave. In this case the calculations are mostly made with use of computer because otherwise its highly doubtful if any time is saved. It is indivually to decide what do we mean by "time-consuming analytical solution". In my discipline even very simple mechanical problems are solved numerically simply because of laziness. \\
\noindent When analytical solution is impossible, which was discussed by eg. Alexander Sadovsky. This means that we have to apply numerical methods in order to find the solution. This does not define that we must do calculations with computer although it usually happens so because of the number of required operations.


\section{Feasibility Study}
\noindent Feasibility analysis involved a thorough assessment of the operational and technical aspects of the proposal.
Feasibility study tested the system proposal and identified whether the user needs may be satisfied using
the current software and hardware technologies, whether the system will be cost effective from a business
point of view and whether it can be developed with the most up to date technologies.
\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
\noindent Operational feasibility is a measure of how well a project solves the problems, and takes advantage of
the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in
the requirements analysis phase of system development. All the operations performed in the software
are very quick and satisfy all the requirements.
\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
\noindent Technological feasibility is carried out to determine whether the project has the capability, in terms
of software, hardware, personnel to handle and fulfill the user requirements. The assessment is based
on an outline design of system requirements in terms of Input, Processes, Output and Procedures.
Automated Building Drawings is technically feasible as it is built up using various open source technologies and it can run on any platform.
\subsection{Economic Feasibility}
\noindent Economic analysis is the most frequently used method to determine the cost/benefit factor for evalu-
ating the effectiveness of a new system. In this analysis we determine whether the benefit is gained
according to the cost invested to develop the project or not. If benefits outweigh costs, only then
the decision is made to design and implement the system. It is important to identify cost and benefit
factors, which can be categorized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Development Cost
\item Operation Cost
\end{itemize}
This System is Economically feasible with 0 Development and Operating Charges
as it is developed in Qt Framework and libdxfrw library which is open source technology and is available free of cost on the internet.

\section{Project Work} 
\textbf{Studied Previous System:}\\
Before starting the project, \\\\
\textbf{Learn octave:}\\
Before starting with project, we have to go through the basics of Octave, such that there
should not be any problem proceeding with project.\\\\
\textbf{Get Familiar with Different methods and their algorithms:}\\
We have gone through algorithms of these algorithms. Then implementation becomes easy\\\\
\textbf{Functions:}\\
The user has been provided some test functions which he can use to test various.\\\\
\textbf{Plots:}\\
Octave provides fltk as the default toolkit. But we can use gnuplot for more accurate plotting by setting them as default toolkit.\\\\
\textbf{Input:}\\
Input values are taken from user or default values defined in the file are used.\\\\
\textbf{Output:}\\
The iterations are performed and it returns the output with the expected precision.
