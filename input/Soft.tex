A Software Requirements Analysis for a software system is a complete 
description of the behavior of a system to be developed. It include functional Requirements
and Software Requirements. In addition to these, the SRS contains 
non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements are 
requirements which impose constraints on the design or implementation.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Purpose}: Web Octave Tool is a web based software and the main purpose of this project is to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform most of difficult Calculation work.
\item Make it work like batch mode. so, that user can give inputs 
together and relax.
\item Help M.Tech and Civil Engineer to analysis structure.
\item Automatic calculation of modal force and modes.
\item Reduce the time for analysis.
\item Provide on-line way to analysis so that individual does not have to 
install anything.
\end{enumerate}

\item{\bf Users of the System}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Client : Clients are the end users that benefit from this software.
They just provide input and gets output.Client of this system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Researcher or student-: They have knowledge of working of procedures and what input is being provided.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Specific Requirements}: This phase covers the whole requirements 
for the system. After understanding the system we need the input data 
to the system then we watch the output and determine whether the output 
from the system is according to our requirements or not. So what we have 
to input and then what we'll get as output is given in this phase. This 
phase also describe the software and non-function requirements of the 
system.
\item {\bf Input Requirements of the System}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Guess points
\item Precision
\item Step-size in case of iterative methods.
\item Required point at which value is to be found
\item User can define his/her problem in function file
\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Output Requirements of the System}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Final output after iterations.
\item Graphs wherever possible in form of images. 
\end{enumerate}
\vskip 0.5cm
\item {\bf Special User Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Automatic Email Generation of Output and Sending to the concerned person.
\item Taking bulk input values in form of CSV file
\end{enumerate}
\vskip 0.5cm
\item {\bf Software Requirements}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Programming language: Octave 4.0
\item software: \LaTeX{}
\item Web Languages: php
\item Database: Mysql 
\item Documentation: Doxygen 1.8.3
\item Text Editor: Vim
\item Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04 or up
\item Revision System: Git

\end{enumerate}
\vskip 0.5cm
\subsection{Non functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Scalability: System should be able to handle a number of users. 
For e.g., handling around thousand users at the same time.
\item Usability: Simple user interfaces that a layman can understand.
\item Speed: Processing input should be done in reasonable time
 i.e. we can say maximum 24 hrs.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
