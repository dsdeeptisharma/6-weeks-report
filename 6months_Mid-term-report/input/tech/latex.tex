\LaTeX, I had never heard about this term before doing this project,
but when I came to know about it's features, found it excellent. 
\LaTeX{ is a document markup language and document preparation system for the \TeX{} 
typesetting program. Within the typesetting system, its name is styled 
as \LaTeX.

Within the typesetting system, its name is styled as \LaTeX. The term 
\LaTeX{} refers only to the language in which documents are written, 
not to the editor used to write those documents. In order to create a 
document in \LaTeX, a .tex file must be created using some form of text 
editor. While most text editors can be used to create a \LaTeX{} document, 
a number of editors have been created specifically for working with \LaTeX.

\LaTeX{} is most widely used by mathematicians, scientists, 
engineers, philosophers, linguists, economists and other scholars in 
academia. As a primary or intermediate format, e.g., translating DocBook 
and other XML-based formats to PDF, \LaTeX{} is used because of the 
high quality of typesetting achievable by \TeX. The typesetting system 
offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities 
for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, 
including numbering and cross-referencing, tables and figures, 
page layout and bibliographies.

\LaTeX{} is intended to provide a high-level language that
accesses the power of \TeX. \LaTeX{} essentially comprises a
collection of \TeX{} macros and a program to process \LaTeX documents. 
Because the \TeX{} formatting commands are very low-level, it is usually 
much simpler for end-users to use \LaTeX{}.

To run LATEX on your own computer, you need  to use a latex distribution. A distribution includes a latex program and (typically) several thousand packages.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  On Windows: MikTEX or TEXLive
   \item On Linux: TEXLive
  \item  On Mac: MacTEX

\LaTeX was first developed in 1985 by Leslie Lamport.
In preparing a \LaTeX{} document, the author 
specifies the logical structure using familiar concepts such as 
chapter, section, table, figure, etc., and lets the \LaTeX{} system 
worry about the presentation of these structures. It therefore 
encourages the separation of layout from content while still allowing 
manual typesetting adjustments where needed. 

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\title{\LaTeX}
\date{}
\begin{document}
  \maketitle 
  \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system 
  for the \TeX{} typesetting program.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

Apart from this lat.pdf; lat.aux, lat.log, lat.pdf files are created by default.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item AUX is a data file format used by Latex
AUX is a data file format used by LaTeX. LaTeX is a macro package which uses TeX typesetting language in its documents. AUX files contain information used for cross-referencing, and is also used to transport information from one compiler run to the next.
\item Some of the compilers are pdftex, Xelatex, Lualatex etc.
Created by pdflatex/ xelatex

Happy Texing :)
