During my training, I also got familiar with a great and open source Operating System, Ubuntu. Firstly, it was quite difficult for a regular MS Windows user to port to Ubuntu. I did all of my project work using this vast operating system. \\
Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment. It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others" or "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".\\
It came under Linux. A kernel normally used by many of the computer persons.You will rarely see a person who is unaware of the term Linux. From perspective of a computer simpleton the one who uses linux mostly shall be having a good knowledge regarding the working of shell,kernel etc.\\

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds. One of a gem of computer scientist who is popular for his OS.\\
Linus was one of the student in Finland and had read a book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.\\
In this book the professor explained about the working of Kernel. To my strange is that he had given the whole source code of his kernel named MINIX in that book. Its really weird but acts as a lucky draw for LInus who took interest in this and with the help of MINIX he created a new OS named Linux. He had told about Andrew in his acknowledgement.\\

Ubuntu's goal is to be secure "out-of-the box". By default user's programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other user's files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes.\\
