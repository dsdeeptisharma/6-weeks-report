Testing a program consists of providing the program with a set of test inputs (or test cases) and
observing if the program behaves as expected. If the program fails to behave as expected, then the
conditions under which failure occurs are noted for later debugging and correction. 


This software had been taken through rigorous test to fully found potential causes of error and system failure
and full focus have been given to cover all possible exceptions that can 
occur and cause failure of the software.
As this software is based on intensive background process it have been taken care that 
if correct input and email address are given then processing of user job can even continue or a least automatically 
restart even after server shuts down or even crash.
