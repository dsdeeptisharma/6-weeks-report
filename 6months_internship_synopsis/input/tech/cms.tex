 Easy CMS is the best, lightest, most amazing CMS. It's fast, awfully quick and astoundingly light. It has been developed using the latest technologies. You don't have to be a techie to use Easy CMS. All you need to do is sip on your coffee and write. Easy CMS will manage all the content like a piece of cake..\\

\newpage
This project is completely open source and the entire code is available 
to the user as and when required. There is Complete developer's 
Documentation as well as User manual alongwith it that helps using it a lot easier.\\
Moreover, anyone can use this service and need not have dependencies installed on their systems and can use this service remotely.\\\\

I am planning to build below mentioned unique features in this system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sound Recognision System
\item Generate PDF Document
\item Private Admin and User Panels

\end{itemize}
